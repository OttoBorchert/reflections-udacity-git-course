> What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a .git directory in the current working directory. It is created 
so that git knows that the current directory is a git repository.

> What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a space to put files that you want to put on the repository. It 
can contain files that are not in the repository, but the files must be in the current 
working directory. 
The staging area will allow us to add multiple files at a single time. In the first lesson, 
one of the advantages of git was the ability to link several files together in a single commit,
this would help with this ability.
