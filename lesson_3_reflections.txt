This would be useful when you want to work with other people or if you have 
multiple computers you want to share the repositories between the computers.

You may be working on a section of code that others have changed and can't 
perform a merge at this second. An automatic pull might disrupt this work flow.
It may also be the case that you are working on a team and need to check 
a person's commit to make they are bug free and that you actually want 
to pull them (I believe this is where the term "pull request" comes from?)

Forks are copies of other people's GitHub repositories that are 
created only on GitHub. You'd use them when you want to make changes 
to someone else's code/project without modifying their project.

Clones are copies of any Git repository, local, remote, or on GitHub. 
You would use this when you want to create a local copy of your own 
remote repository or copies of collaborators repositories.

Branches are a way to distiguish between specific commits of a 
repository. They are used to create separate code/project files 
that may eventually be merged into a master branch. For example, 
you may use a branch to test a new functionality before releasing 
it to the public, or attempt a wide refactor, all without changing 
the base, master branch.
