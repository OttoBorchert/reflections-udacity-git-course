This would be useful when you want to work with other people or if you have 
multiple computers you want to share the repositories between the computers.

You may be working on a section of code that others have changed and can't 
perform a merge at this second. An automatic pull might disrupt this work flow.
It may also be the case that you are working on a team and need to check 
a person's commit to make they are bug free and that you actually want 
to pull them (I believe this is where the term "pull request" comes from?)
